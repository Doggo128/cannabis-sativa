                        Cannabis Sativa starts off as a seedling, sprouts in soil, and within a few weeks: you have entered the vegatative stage.<br>

     Seeds will crack and develop taproots after 3-10 days in germination. Once the taproot has sprouted; Place about 2’’ deep in soil, with the Taproot facing DOWN, then loosely cover the seed with soil. The seed will break the soil in about a week.<br><br>

     It is important to not give too much water to the growing medium. Too much water will drown the seedling. Once the seedling has sprouted, give it just enough light to survive. Do not expose to high intensity grow lights just yet.
                    </p>
